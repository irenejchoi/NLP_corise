Average of Word2Vec + MLP Layer\n","1. Can we concatenate 3 token embeddings and then average them? Does this do better than the previous method?\n","1. Build an embedding layer based model.\n","1. **Extension**: Explore different parameters, features and architectures. \n","\n","###  Evaluation\n","We’ll be evaluating our models on the following metric: \n","\n","1. Accuracy: is the ratio of the number of correctly classified instances to the total number of instances\n","1. **Extension**: this is a multi-class classification problem, visualize a [confusion matrix](https://torchmetrics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/references/functional.html#confusion-matrix-func) of N*N of actual class vs predicted class (N = number of classes).\n","\n","\n","### Instructions\n","\n","1. We've provide scaffolding for all the boiler plate PyTorch code to get to our first model. This covers downloading and parsing the dataset, training code for the baseline model. **Make sure to read all the steps and internalize what is happening**.\n","1. At this point our model gets to an accuracy of about 0.32. After this we'll try to improve the model by using sliding windows of text instead of just one word at a time. **Does this improve accuracy?**\n","1. The third model we're going to build is an embedding layer based model. Here instead of using pre-trained word-embeddings we'll be creating new vectors as part of the training process. **How do you think this model will perform?**\n","1. **Extension**: We've suggested a bunch of extensions to the project so go crazy, tweak any parts of the pipeline and see if you can beat all the current modes.\n","\n","### Code Overview\n","- Dependencies: Python dependencies and loading the spacy model\n","- Project\n","  - Dataset: Download the conversation dataset and parse it into a pytorch Dataset\n","  - Trainer: Trainer function to help with multi-epoch training\n","  - Model 1: Simple Word2Vec + MLP model\n","  - Model 2: Sliding window trigram (Word2Vec)\n","  - Model 3: Embedding bag based model on Trigram\n","- Extensions\n"," \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"2TWogdWh1MWp"},"source":["# Dependencies\n","\n","✨ Now let's get started and to kick things off as always we install some dependencies."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":65911,"status":"ok","timestamp":1658128846063,"user":{"displayName":"Irene Choi","userId":"10075117482329515552"},"user_tz":300},"id":"Uj-w6eV7_abU"},"outputs":[],"source":["%%capture\n","# Install all the required dependencies for the project\n","!pip install pytorch-lightning==1.5.10 spacy==2.2.4\n","!python -m spacy download en_core_web_md"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"SGpYPUn2uVBK"},"source":["Import all the necessary libraries we need throughout the project."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":4250,"status":"ok","timestamp":1658128850290,"user":{"displayName":"Irene Choi","userId":"10075117482329515552"},"user_tz":300},"id":"NSDbwEoL8-0r"},"outputs":[],"source":["from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n","from torch import nn\n","from torch.nn.utils.rnn import pad_sequence\n","from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset, random_split\n","from collections import Counter\n","import en_core_web_md\n","import numpy as np\n","import pytorch_lightning as pl\n","import spacy\n","import torch\n","import torch.nn.functional as F\n","import torchmetrics"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"lyS2zGroubkB"},"source":["First things first, let's load the Spacy data which comes with pre-trainined embeddings.
